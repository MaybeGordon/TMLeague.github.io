name: The Silent League of Faceless Men
rules: https://www.thronemaster.net/?goto=community&sub=forum&fid=15&tid=81775
note: This tournament was inspired by the \"Silent\" games run by Karijin, where players are not allowed to talk/whisper in the chat and the only way to communicate is showing your intentions (and guessing othersâ€™) through the orders played.
