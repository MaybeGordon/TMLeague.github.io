# Contribution
To add new league data or update existing, files should be created and modified in a new branch and pull request to master must be created.

## Main
Application configuration files are `.json` files located in appropriate directories.
Main application configuration is in [home.json](src/TMLeague/wwwroot/data/home.json).
To add a new league it is necessary to:
* add a new `<identifier>` in `leagues` array
* add a new dictionary with name equal to the `<identifier>` to [leagues](/src/TMLeague/wwwroot/data/leagues) directory.
* add a new `.json` file with the name equal to the `<identifier>.json` e.g. [leagues/sl/sl.json](/src/TMLeague/wwwroot/data/leagues/sl/sl.json) for identifier `sl`.
* add a new image file in the league directory e.g. [leagues/sl/sl.png](/src/TMLeague/wwwroot/data/leagues/sl/sl.png). It can be used as button background in the **Main page**.

League has seasons. Seasons have divisions. General structure looks like:
```
/src/TMLeague/wwwroot/data/leagues
+---<leagueId>
|   |   <leagueId>.json

# Importing games locally
To import games locally, it is needed to have installed [.NET6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0). Then it is possible to execute following command from the root folder:
```
dotnet run --project src/TMGameImporter/TMGameImporter.csproj -c Release --BaseLocation src/TMLeague/wwwroot/data --FetchFinishedDivisions false
```
where `FetchFinishedDivisions` should be set to `true` when already fetched division results needs to be recalculated.
