    "specialNote": "Special notice: Please consider the whole board carefully before making any decision that could result in Spoiling or Kingmaking. ‚‚A king who does nothing is no king at all.‘‘ Less poetically, if you allow another player to win or shirk your responsibility off to other player(s) which results in a third players win, not only will you not be able to win the game, but you will also be held accountable for Spoiling/Kingmaking. Making a small sacrifice for the realm should be in your own best interest. So please, be vigilant and take your responsibility seriously."
